<h1>Language Tutor</h1>

This is a quick language tutor script I wrote to help me master japanese 
kana for a course I was taking in my spare time.  It's pretty simple, but
with a few obvious and easy modifications it should be easy enough to add
more languages.

Currently it only supports Japanese -- but I might add more later.  I'm
planning a trip to Europe and it never hurts to brush up on French.
